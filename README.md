\# Open-Iris-FYP



\## Stage 1 – Camera \& Image Capture ✅



\### Overview

This is the first stage of the Open-Iris FYP project.  

The goal of Stage 1 is to \*\*test the feasibility of iris capture\*\* using a webcam and OpenCV.  

Successful completion of this stage proves that the hardware works and the software setup is correct.



\### Features Completed

\- Open webcam and live video stream

\- Capture iris images

\- Save captured images to disk in a structured folder

\- Hardware and OpenCV integration verified



\### Folder Structure

Open-Iris-FYP/

├── test\_camera.py # Stage 1 script

├── .gitignore # Files/folders ignored by Git

├── README.md # This file

├── iris-sample/ # Sample captured iris images (optional)





\### How to Run

1\. Install Python 3.11+  

2\. Install dependencies:

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt



\### Run the camera script:

python test\_camera.py



\###Captured images will be saved to the iris-sample folder



\##Notes

This stage is fully functional and ready for Stage 2: Dataset preparation and preprocessing.



OpenCV version used: 4.x



Tested on Windows 10/11
